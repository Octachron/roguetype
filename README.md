Roguetype is the first roguelike written in the OCaml type System.

In a world full of GADTs and type constraints, discover hidden paths through
mountains and forest, vanquish dragons, traverse the seven functor gates to
finally prove that the victory type is inhabited.

## How to play with the marvelous interface Roguetype

Refer to the `examples/start.ml` example as a simple path through the first
level of Roguetype. Winning `Roguetype` merely requires to call the `win`
defined inside the `Lvl8` functor of the `Game` module.
